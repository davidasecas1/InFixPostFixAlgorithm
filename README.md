# InFixPostFixAlgorithm
This algorithm is used to make operations written directly in the console in this form: a*b/c+e-f. Being able to recognise the priorities between the operations and to make as many operations as you want with the limit of the float data type. Also you can add brackets to the operations so you can give a higher priority to the operation(s) between them. 
The purpose of this algorithm is to add it to a calculator i have being doing which is also in my github.
